# Phone Usage & Workplace Productivity – Exploratory Study

## Objective
To investigate the impact of mobile phone usage—especially social media scrolling—on productivity and anxiety at work.

## Method
- **Tool**: Qualtrics Survey
- **Participants**: 78 professionals
- **Metrics Captured**:
  - Daily phone use duration
  - Social media frequency
  - Stress and anxiety levels
  - Work productivity self-assessment
  - Behavior control strategies

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- R for Linear Regression
- Copilot + Thematic Coding (Manual)

## Challenges
- Data inconsistencies and limited sample size reduced reliability of regression findings.
- No statistically significant correlation between scrolling and anxiety was detected.
- Many participants reported **contradictory habits** or **unclear self-awareness** of their phone use patterns.

## Conclusion
Although results were inconclusive, the project laid groundwork for:
- Better survey structuring
- Sampling improvements
- Validated models of digital distraction

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of **sample size** and **data quality**
- Need for a blend of **quantitative + qualitative** methods
- How to **manage research setbacks** transparently in a project lifecycle

## 🔮 Future Focus: Data Ethics in Cybersecurity & Fraud Prevention

Inspired by the growing digital threat landscape, I aim to explore:

- **Fraudulent data detection using anomaly detection models**
- **Behavioral analytics to prevent cyberattacks**
