# Phone Usage & Workplace Productivity – Exploratory Study

## Objective
To investigate the impact of mobile phone usage—especially social media scrolling—on productivity and anxiety at work.

  - Social media frequency
  - Stress and anxiety levels
  - Work productivity self-assessment
  - Behavior control strategies

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- R for Linear Regression
- Copilot + Thematic Coding (Manual)

## Challenges
- Data inconsistencies and limited sample size reduced reliability of regression findings.
- No statistically significant correlation between scrolling and anxiety was detected.
- Many participants reported **contradictory habits** or **unclear self-awareness** of their phone use patterns.

## Conclusion
